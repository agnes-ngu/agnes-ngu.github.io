to do:
- collapsing side nav or shrink on scroll
- change nav bar so it sticks and can see background without hover. when do hover, expand into wider bar showing links
- images, graphics, color
- up button that scrolls back to top
- other nav link pages
- see whther "top" calculated from min listened, times played, or other (explnain and have settings to change and see what causes what results)
- call python every time call js; py still condenses functions into json for js to extract data and display. EXCEPT will call eveyrtime so i can implement new py functions without having to recall js manually. has smth to do with creating api and calling? currently is asynch calling js/py or wtvr.
- page: see all data, features to sort
- rewrite data to be able to display different kinds of wrapped
- ability to search wrapped by year (on nav?)
- other views: top albums, top song min, top genres, total genres, day of top song/artist most listened to

extra feat:
- animated scrolling (parallax?)
- hiding scroll bar
- dots for each page
- starting screen that introduces/ leads into following pages
- responsive layout design (adjust by screen size)
- use spotify api to get data on specific info from spotify (ie. artist profile pic)
- custom wrapped page (by year, see if want to see total minutes, top artists, songs, podcasts, etc)
- setting: change to hor swipe instead of vert scrolling
- homepage?
