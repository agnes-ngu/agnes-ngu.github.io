to do:
- collapsing side nav or shrink on scroll
- title page: slow spinning vinyl with go button. when hover, spin faster. on click, expand to fill screen to transition to next pg. keep vinyl enlarged on side of page (sticking out like with irl sleeve) for decor/bkg? OR maybe have vinyl break upon click. OR since named unwrapped, symbolize unwrapping somehow
    - ACTUALLY: do top half vinyl sticking up from bottom of page saying go. on hover, does spin and color change blah blah. on click, drags up next screen, where bottom half of clock (same giant size) sticks out of top edge.
    - use hourglass symbol otherwise?
- change title page bg color
- change nav bar so it sticks and can see background without hover. when do hover, expand into wider bar showing links
- images, graphics, color
- up button that scrolls back to top
- other nav link pages
- see whther "top" calculated from min listened, times played, or other (explnain and have settings to change and see what causes what results)
- call python every time call js; py still condenses functions into json for js to extract data and display. EXCEPT will call eveyrtime so i can implement new py functions without having to recall js manually. has smth to do with creating api and calling? currently is asynch calling js/py or wtvr.
- page: see all data, features to sort
- rewrite data to be able to display different kinds of wrapped
- ability to search wrapped by year (on nav?)
- other views: top albums, top song min, top genres, total genres, day of top song/artist most listened to

extra feat:
- animated scrolling (parallax?)
- hiding scroll bar
- dots for each page
- starting screen that introduces/ leads into following pages
- responsive layout design (adjust by screen size)
- use spotify api to get data on specific info from spotify (ie. artist profile pic)
- custom wrapped page (by year, see if want to see total minutes, top artists, songs, podcasts, etc)
- setting: change to hor swipe instead of vert scrolling
- homepage?
